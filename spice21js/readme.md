# Spice21Js

JavaScript interface to the Spice21 simulator. 
https://github.com/HW21/Spice21

Spice21's core simulator is written in Rust. 
JavaScript bindings are largely creditable to two projects: 

* [Neon's](https://neon-bindings.com/) Rust-Node bindings, and 
* [ProtobufJS's](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protobufjs) compiler and reflection-enabled protocol-buffer classes

As of version `0.1.4`, Spice21's `dcop` is the sole analysis supported in JavaScript.
